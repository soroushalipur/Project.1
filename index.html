            <h1>History of Apple</h1>
            <p>
                Apple was founded on April 1, 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wein. The company was originally founded to sell a computer kit that Steve Jobs built with his friends in his garage. They called their computer kit Apple I.
    
                Apple officially started its work as a commercial company on January 3, 1977. At this time, Ronald Wayne sold his share for $800 and separated from his friends. From the beginning, this company was known as "Apple Computer Company" until the word "Computer" was removed from it in 2007, and now it is called only Apple.In the same year, they launched the second Apple product called Apple II, which sold well. In 1980, the third version of this computer entered the market. These products gave Apple such credibility and reputation that the company was able to break the record of public stock prices in its initial public offering. Prior to that, the record for the price of a public stock in an IPO was held by Ford Motor Company, but when Apple's stock went public, it broke all records.Apple's next most important product at that time was the Macintosh computer, which was produced in 1984. This product for the first time with a TV commercial 1. 5 million dollars called "1984" made by Ridley Scott was introduced. Macintosh sales had ups and downs. Its initial sales were successful but gradually declined due to its high price and limited range of compatible software. After some time, Apple was able to improve its sales with the price of the first laser printer and a software package compatible with Macintosh.
